# BeerSearchApp
A simple ReactNative app

Is an example of, ahem, CV-driven development

- A very simple (for now) [ReactNative](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app
- Uses [NativeBase](https://docs.nativebase.io/) for widgets, UI
- You can search by name for beers against [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) `REST` `API`
- Uses [`GraphQL`](https://graphql.org/). [Wrapping](https://github.com/JohnPaulHarold/BeerAPIGraphQL) the above `REST` `API`.
